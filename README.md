Workflow 
Game Initialization:

1.The page loads, generating a random number between 1 and 100.
The game interface is displayed with a prompt to "Guess a number between 1 and 100".
User Interaction:

2.The user enters a guess and clicks the "Submit Guess" button.
The system checks if the input is a valid number between 1 and 100.
Check Guess:

3.If the guess is valid:
If the guess matches the random number, the system displays a congratulatory message and shows the "Play Again" button.
If the guess is too low or too high, the system provides feedback, asking the user to try again.
The number of attempts is tracked and updated.
Play Again:

Once the game is over (either the user guesses correctly or chooses to start over), the user can click "Play Again" to reset the game:
The random number is regenerated, and the attempt count resets to zero.
The feedback messages and input fields are cleared, and the game restarts.
